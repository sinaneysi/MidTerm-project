## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

```bash
# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh

# Install Docker Compose
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```
Getting Started
Configuration
Before running the services, create an .env file with the following variables:

env
Copy code
ACME_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
WEB_AUTH_USER=username
WEB_AUTH_PASS=password
SUB=subdomain
DOMAIN_ADDRESS=yourdomain.com
Running the Services
Run Traefik using the following command:

```bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
```
This will start Traefik as a Docker service.

Traefik Configuration
Traefik is configured to handle routing, SSL termination, and includes a basic authentication middleware for the Traefik dashboard. Update Traefik labels in the docker-compose.yml file as needed.

Access the Traefik dashboard at http://sub.yourdomain.com.

Networks
The Traefik service is connected to the web_net Docker network.

Volumes
A volume named traefik-acme is created for storing Let's Encrypt certificates.

Additional Notes
Ensure the necessary ports are open in your firewall.
Customize Traefik labels for your specific domain and authentication credentials.
Adjust security measures as needed for your environment.
